# PRD: Marketing & Growth Strategy

## Introduction

Mykadoo needs a comprehensive marketing and growth strategy to attract users, drive engagement, and achieve sustainable growth. This PRD defines marketing channels, campaigns, growth tactics, analytics, and community-building initiatives that complement the SEO/content foundation (PRD 0004) and drive user acquisition, activation, and retention.

## Problem Statement

Without a structured marketing and growth strategy:
- User acquisition is slow and unpredictable
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is unknown or too high
- Growth is organic-only (missing paid/viral channels)
- Marketing ROI is unclear (poor attribution)
- User retention is low (no lifecycle marketing)
- Competitive advantage is lost to well-marketed alternatives
- Revenue growth is limited by audience reach
- Word-of-mouth is not systematically encouraged

## Goals

1. Acquire 10,000 users in first 6 months (1,667/month average)
2. Achieve <$10 customer acquisition cost (CAC) for free users
3. Maintain 40%+ monthly active user (MAU) retention rate
4. Generate 20% of traffic from paid channels (ads, partnerships)
5. Build email list of 5,000+ subscribers in 6 months
6. Achieve 15% viral coefficient (referrals per user)
7. Establish brand presence on 3+ social media channels
8. Launch 2+ successful marketing campaigns per quarter
9. Track marketing attribution with 90%+ accuracy
10. Build community of 1,000+ engaged users (forum, social)
