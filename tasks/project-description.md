This is the mykadoo project repository. It is a complete solution for an AI-powered gift search engine that helps users find the perfect gifts based on their preferences and interests.

Goals:

1. Develop an AI algorithm that can analyze user preferences and suggest relevant gift ideas. The AI algorithm should be configurable to allow for updates and improvements over time. Also multiple levels of AI models should be used with fallback mechanism, to ensure that the best cost performance is achieved. The AI could be done based on multiple agent profiles with different personalities (including names to make it more natural), that can interact with the user in a conversational way to better understand their needs. In such a case, multiple AI providers and models can be used to provide a diverse range of suggestions.
2. Create a user-friendly interface for users to input their preferences and view gift suggestions.
3. Integrate with popular e-commerce and affiliate platforms to provide direct links for purchasing suggested gifts (with affiliate links).
4. Implement a recommendation system that learns from user interactions to improve gift suggestions over time.
5. Ensure the platform is scalable and can handle a large number of users and gift suggestions.
6. Provide analytics and reporting features for users to track their gift searches and purchases.
7. Ensure data privacy and security for user information and preferences.
8. Set up a tiered subscription model to monetize the platform, offering basic features for free and premium features for paid users:
- Free: Access to standard gift suggestions and limited search profiles (ex. 3).
- Gold: Larger number of search profiles (ex. 10), sharable wishlists.
- Platinum: Everything in gold + unlimited search profiles, calendar-based gift reminders.
9. Implement a feedback system for users to rate gift suggestions and provide input for further improvements.
10. Optimize the platform for mobile devices to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
11. Provide content areas and article pages with gift guides, tips, and trends to engage users and improve SEO.
12. Set up a robust backend infrastructure to support AI processing, data storage, and user management
13. Set up a robust CMS backend that can connect to RSS feeds, curate their content using AI to filter relevant articles, and create drafts for editing and review before publishing. Admin users should be able to manage content, schedule posts, and monitor site performance.
14. Ensure the platform is compliant with relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR for data protection and accessibility standards for inclusive design.
15. The website should have a modern, clean, and visually appealing design that reflects the brand identity of mykadoo. It should be easy to navigate, with clear calls to action and a focus on user experience. The brand should be warm, friendly, and trustworthy, appealing to a wide audience looking for gift ideas.
16. The main website should redirect to localized versions (subdomains) based on the user's location, ensuring that users see content and gift suggestions relevant to their region. Each localized version should support local currencies, languages, affiliate platforms and payment systems.
17. Implement SEO best practices to improve search engine rankings and drive organic traffic to the platform.
18. Set up automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure code quality and streamline the development process.
19. Provide comprehensive documentation for the platform, including user guides, API documentation, and developer resources.
20. Create native mobile applications for iOS and Android to complement the web platform and provide a seamless user experience across devices.
21. Implement social media integration to allow users to share gift suggestions and wishlists with their networks.
22. Set up customer support channels, including a help center, FAQ section, and live chat support, to assist users with any issues or questions.
23. Monitor platform performance and user engagement metrics to identify areas for improvement and optimize the user experience.
24. Plan and execute marketing campaigns to promote the platform and attract new users.
