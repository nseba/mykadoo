# Generate Tasks

Generate detailed, executable task lists from Product Requirements Documents with automated quality gates.

## Instructions

### When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- User points to a specific PRD file
- User asks to "generate tasks from PRD"
- User says "create implementation plan"
- Ready to convert requirements into actionable steps

### Process

1. **Receive PRD Reference**
   - User specifies PRD file (e.g., "generate tasks from 0001-prd-user-auth.md")
   - Locate and read the PRD file

2. **Analyze PRD**
   - Read all functional requirements
   - Understand user stories and acceptance criteria
   - Note technical considerations and constraints
   - Identify success metrics

3. **Assess Current State**
   - Review existing codebase architecture and patterns
   - Identify existing components that can be leveraged
   - Find related files that need modification
   - Check Docker and Helm configurations
   - Note testing infrastructure and conventions

4. **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks**
   - Create high-level tasks (typically 5-8 parent tasks)
   - Logical grouping of work
   - Present to user in task list format
   - **IMPORTANT:** Wait for user confirmation ("Go")

5. **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks** (After "Go")
   - Break down each parent into actionable steps
   - Include implementation details
   - Add quality verification steps for EACH parent task:
     * Lint verification sub-task
     * Test suite verification sub-task
     * Build verification sub-task
     * System functionality check
     * Docker/Helm update if needed

6. **Identify Relevant Files**
   - List all files to create or modify
   - Include test files
   - Provide brief description for each

7. **Save Task List**
   - Filename: `/tasks/tasks-[prd-file-name].md`
   - Example: If PRD is `0001-prd-user-auth.md`, save as `tasks-0001-prd-user-auth.md`

### Task Structure Requirements

Each parent task MUST include these final sub-tasks:
```markdown
- [ ] X.Y Run linter and verify zero warnings
- [ ] X.Y+1 Run full test suite and verify all tests pass
- [ ] X.Y+2 Build project and verify successful compilation
- [ ] X.Y+3 Verify system functionality end-to-end
- [ ] X.Y+4 Update Docker configurations if deployment changes needed
- [ ] X.Y+5 Update Helm chart if deployment changes needed
```

### Execution Model

**CRITICAL:** The task list enables automated execution:
- Execute ALL sub-tasks under a parent automatically
- Do NOT require permission between sub-tasks
- ONLY pause for confirmation between parent tasks
- Quality gates are enforced automatically

### Output Format

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `path/to/file.ts` - Description of file purpose
- `path/to/file.test.ts` - Unit tests for file.ts
- `path/to/component.tsx` - React component description
- `path/to/component.test.tsx` - Component tests

### Notes

- Test files placed alongside code
- Use `yarn nx test [project]` to run tests
- Use `yarn nx lint [project]` to run linter

### Example 2: Simple Feature

**User Input:**
```
Generate tasks from 0005-prd-export-data.md
```

**Analysis:**
- PRD specifies JSON/CSV export
- Needs new API endpoint
- Requires background job for large exports

## Quality Assurance

Every generated task list MUST ensure:

1. **Completeness**
   - All PRD functional requirements covered
   - No missing implementation steps
   - Quality gates for every parent task

2. **Incremental Progress**
   - Each parent task is independently valuable
   - System remains functional after each task
   - No breaking changes between tasks

3. **Testability**
   - Test creation included in sub-tasks
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Integration tests for complex flows

4. **Deployment Readiness**
   - Docker/Helm checks when needed
   - Configuration updates included
   - Migration steps if database changes

## Commit Protocol

After completing all sub-tasks in a parent task:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): clear summary of parent task

Detailed description:
- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

Technical notes:
- Implementation details
- Important decisions made

## Key Principles

1. **Automated Execution:** Sub-tasks execute without interruption
2. **Quality First:** Never skip verification steps
3. **Clear Boundaries:** Explicit pause between parent tasks
4. **Incremental Value:** Each parent task delivers working functionality
5. **Comprehensive Coverage:** All aspects of PRD addressed
